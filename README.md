# Playground

Hello, this is a simple playground project.
Goal here is non-existent, I wanted to practice
so I have this to commit and sync between computers.

Right now it has;
##001
 The Cookie watching simple javascript app-ish thingy. Will build on that in future
##002
 Again something to do with cookies, but this one is more of a code-clipboard-test-thingy.
##003
 Ecology Simulator!
###JSON
 A Chuck Norris Quote generator, with json data from cnfacts or something like that.
###Twitch
 Using the twitch api, a tool to check on streamers. 
###Weather
 Using accuweather's api. A simple current weather app.
###Wikia
 A tool that utilizes wikipedia api and lists wikipedia searches as if it was a search engine.
